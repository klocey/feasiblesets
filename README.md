Brief description
-----------------
This repository contains Python code and data used by Ken Locey and Ethan White to examine distributions of species abundance among microbial and macrobial communities.


Included files
-------------------------

* Python modules (feasible_functions.py) to generate and examine feasible sets and random macrostates thereof
* Python scripts to reproduce results and figures used by Locey and White (in final prep)
* A dictionary of random macrostates (coming). This would be expensive for others to reproduce.
* A documentation file to describe what all this feasible set nonsense is for



Programs and packages used by the authors
-------------------------------

Python version 2.6.5 or higher
Cython
Sage version 4.7.2 or higher
